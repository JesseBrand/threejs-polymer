This project includes a library of elements to use three.js object and canvasses by using polymer elements.

The repository is currently not in a state in which you can import it into any project and . Feel free to browse through it and use it as a resource for learning polymer and/or three.js, but I would suggest refraining from using the repo as-is in your projects until it is ready.

That said, I expect to have the repository ready to be used in such a way, including a first release tag, within a few days.
